Welcome to the MetaMolEs wiki!

The team is working like moles digging through in tons of available (back)ground data to reach the best metabolic path for the desired metabolite synthesis.

Our purpose is to create **A tool that suggests enzymes with predicted promiscuous activity specific to a compound of interest based on activity to chemically similar compounds.** or somewhat similar.

Check [Project Scoping](https://github.com/theicechol/metamoles/wiki/Project-Scoping) for further information about the project scope.

See [Literature Review](https://github.com/theicechol/metamoles/wiki/Literature-Review) for our relevant studies and our background research.
