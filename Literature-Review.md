> The authors utilized supported vector machine (SVM) to predict the reactivity of chemical reactions. The model was trained on randomly generated chemical reactions which were performed by a robot equipped with sufficient characterization instruments. The generated model can efficiently predict the reactivity the other reactions with the reaction universe. The SVM model might be applicable to this project using similar vector representation shown in the article.

biochemical knowledge through graph databases. *PLoS ONE* 12(7): e0179130.**
> The authors created a graph database (biochem4j) that integrates organism, enzyme, reaction, and product data from ChEBI, MNXref, Rhea, KEGG, UniProt, and NCBI. The data exists as nodes that are connected by specified relationships; querying occurs using the CYPHER language. This database was created with metabolic engineering in mind, so it readily connects chemical products with pathways from a starting material. The [text scraping](https://github.com/synbiochem/biochem4j) and some implementation code is in Python and has [Python dependencies](https://github.com/synbiochem/synbiochem-py).

**Jeffryes et al. MINEs: open access databases of computationally predicted enzyme promiscuity products for untargeted metabolomics. *J Cheminform* (2015) 7:44.**
> The authors created MINEs as an extension to databases with known enzyme products and metabolites. The [database](http://minedatabase.mcsanl.gov) was populated using the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer algorithm to propose novel chemical structures and reactions for the database. These novel entries are suspected enzyme sidereactions that account for the currently unidentified peaks in metabolomics (mostly LCMS) data.

*Could be useful in terms of predicted enzyme promiscuity*
