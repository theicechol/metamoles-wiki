**Wang, Lin, et al. "A review of computational tools for design and reconstruction of metabolic pathways." Synthetic and systems biotechnology 2.4 (2017)**

> In this paper the authors review a broad range of existing computational tools for retrobiosynthetic pathway design. They group these tools into three categories based on network representation, and search strategy: graph-based, stoichiometry-based, and retrosynthesis-based. The authors go into some technical detail around key requirements of a design tool, including the database, network representation, network pruning, search algorithm, and pathway ranking. For each of these requirements the authors discuss different existing implementation strategies and tradeoffs between one implementation over the other. It looks as though a majority of the tools reviewed use KEGG as their database.
