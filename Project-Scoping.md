## Project scoping and brainstorm


#### Purpose: to develop a program that suggests biosynthetic enzyme pathways for user-provided molecular end products.

#### Drafted FlowChart
![Drafted_FlowChart](https://github.com/theicechol/metamoles/blob/master/figures/FlowChart_2.png "FlowChart_2")

#### To do:
* Lit review
  * Everyone find/read ~3 papers relevant to the project at hand, and generate an [annotated bibliography](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/annotatedbibliography)
  
See the further review for [Metabolic pathway databases and model repositories](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40484-017-0108-3.pdf)

#### Sub-problems:
* Development plan
  * Gantt Charts
* Molecule handling
  * SMILES strings? [add link]()

#### Tools:
* Data Extraction
  * Compounds
  * Enzymes
  * Reactions
* Databases (roughly organized in order of which ones we will focus on)
  * [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
  * [ATLAS](http://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/atlas/)
  * [Brenda?](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/)
  * [MetaCyc?](https://metacyc.org/)
  * [Biochem4j?](https://github.com/synbiochem/biochem4j)
* Validation
  * Native Pathway e.g. GTP to Folate
  * Unnatural but reported pathways
* Existing Software
  * RDKit
* [Chemical similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_similarity)

Key practical questions to be solved
- What tools and methods are available right now?
- Why do we have to do this? Will it be useful? Clarify the novelty of this project!
- How do we extract data from the available database?
- How to validate the model's accuracy?
- What is our short-term, medium, and long-term goals?
- How to assign each part of the project to our members appropriately?
